# Remez algorithm implementaiton
This is a project from Digital Signal Processing class to implement Remez algorithm.

## Requirements:
To run the code it is necessary to have the following libraries:
* matplotlib
* numpy
* scipy
* sympy

To install all of them just run:

    pip3 install requirements.txt

## How to run:
The code is set to test the function cos(x) for an interval of [0,2pi] with a interpolation polynomial of degree 5. To test with different arguments, just change the variables in the file run.py

Then run:

    python3 run.py
